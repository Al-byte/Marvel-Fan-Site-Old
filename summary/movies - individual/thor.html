              he would be formally recognized as crown prince. Loki looks on enviously. Before 
              Odin can follow through with the proclamation, he senses the presence of intruders. 
              Three Frost Giants infiltrate the secure rooms that hold the Casket. However, the 
              Destroyer appears and stops the intruders from reattaining the casket, killing all

              a frozen, crumbling wasteland. They confront Laufey who taunts the Asgardian warriors. 
              More Frost Giants surround the six as Laufey allows them the chance to leave peacefully. 
              Loki manages to persuade his brother into accepting the offer and they prepare to depart. 
              However, Thor reacts brashly to a Frost Giant's insult and a battle starts. 
              During the battle, Loki experiences an unusual reaction when he is touched by

              tries to calm his father, but is quickly silenced. Odin strips Thor of his 
              power, banishes him to Earth and sends his hammer, Mjølnir, after him a few

              Once again he starts fighting as he wakes up and he is eventually tranquilized.

              appearance of Thor's hammer. Unsure of what to do, the trio goes back to 
              the hospital but Thor has escaped. As they drive off in the van, they hit 
              the Asgardian man again and knock him out, but this time they take him

              After beating up many agents, and being targeted by Clint Barton, Thor finally

              Thor, who surreptitiously grabs Foster's notebook on the way out. Back in town, Selvig 
              takes Thor out for a drink, now trying to convince Thor to leave Foster alone due to 
              the complications he has and would continue to cause her. The two chug boilermakers 
              and bond. Thor brings the drunk Selvig to Foster's trailer. Thor and Foster go outside 
              to gaze at the stars, and Thor explains the Nine Realms and the Bifrost Bridge 
              to her. She figures the bridge is the theoretical Einstein-Rosen Bridge wormhole, 
              the very same that she has been researching.</p>

              Laufey. It is revealed that Loki was the one who let the Frost Giants into Asgard to 
              try to retrieve the casket during Thor's coronation. He makes a deal with Laufey 
              that he will let them into Asgard again to kill Odin and have their casket, and in 
              return, they will return home in peace. Loki then commands the Destroyer to go to 
              Earth and kill Thor.</p>

Thor and the three scientists attempt to get everyone away safely. Thor confronts the Destroyer and asks Loki, who can see and hear what is going on from Asgard, to leave the humans alone in return for himself. The Destroyer gives Thor a vicious backhand slap and sends him tumbling, apparently dead. Jane runs to the body in tears. However, Thor's selfless act of protection proves him worthy to once again wield Mjølnir, which frees itself from the crater and returns to Thor's hand. He is restored to full life and vigor and once again fitted in his red cape and armor. He easily defeats the Destroyer and tries to return to Asgard, promising Foster he will return.</p>

Laufey goes to Odin's bedchamber and, as he prepares to kill the Norse god, Loki kills Laufey to appear to be the hero. Although frozen, Heimdall is conscious and manages to break free and brings Thor back to Asgard. Thor flies quickly to fight the Frost Giants.</p>

When the bridge shatters, the two brothers fall into space but Odin arrives and catches Thor, who holds Loki's staff. Loki admits defeat and allows himself to fall, disappearing into the void.</p>

However, Heimdall, gazing out over the severed edge of the Rainbow Bridge, assures him that Foster is looking for him. Back on Earth, Foster is in a new lab with new equipment, now being assisted by S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>
