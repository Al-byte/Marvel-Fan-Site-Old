Toomes convinces his crew to not surrender the Chitauri technology already scavenged from the battle and use it to further a criminal agenda. Years later, the crew are making big on exotic weapons deals, and Toomes begins wearing a winged harness that gives him the ability to fly.</p>

Over the objections of his aunt, May Parker, Parker quits his school's decathlon team in order to spend more time focusing on his "Stark Industries Internship", which is a cover for his crimefighting activities as Spider-Man. One night, after preventing Toomes' associates from robbing an ATM, Parker returns to his Queens apartment, where his best friend, Ned Leeds, discovers his secret identity.</p>

Parker nearly drowns while intervening, but is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against involvement with the dangerous criminals. Later, angry with Brice for jeopardizing the operation, Toomes accidentally kills him with one of their weapons, and gives his gauntlet to Shultz.</p>

              <p class="card-text text-left" style="line-height: 1.6">Retrieving a Chitauri weapon left behind by Brice, Parker works with Ned to remove the power core. A tracking device leads Schultz to Midtown School of Science and Technology, but Parker and Leeds manage to evade him. After planting his own tracking device on Schultz and learning that it leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for Nationals. Working with Leeds, Parker disables the tracker implanted in his Spider-Man Suit and unlocks all its secret features, including the built-in AI that Parker later names Karen.</p>

When he discovers that the Chitauri Energy Core is unstable, Parker tracks Leeds to the Washington Monument, arriving just as the core explodes and traps Leeds in an elevator. Evading local authorities, Parker manages to save Leeds and his fellow classmates, including Liz, before the elevator plummets.</p>

Confronting Toomes and his associates at the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures the group's new buyer Mac Gargan, but botches an FBI operation which was attempting to arrest everyone involved in the weapon sales. Toomes avoids after Parker's attempts to shut down a malfunctioning weapon causes it to overload and tear the ferry in half. Stark, who had arranged for the FBI to apprehend Toomes, helps Parker save the passengers.</p>

Deciding Parker can no longer be trusted, Stark demands the suit back. Peter is left very upset, deciding afterwards to distance himself from Spider-Man and instead begins concentrating on his personal life. To that end, he finally makes a date with Liz and arranges to take her to the upcoming homecoming dance. Meanwhile, most of Toomes' workers decide to leave the operation now they know Stark is on their trail. With most of their Chitauri technology gone, Toomes decides to make one final hit which will set him and his few remaining associates up for life.</p>

Parker only just manages to maintain his composure, however during the car ride to the dance Toomes learns that Peter went missing whenever Spider-Man was around and deduces his secret. When Liz is out of the way, Toomes tells Parker he'll let him live since he saved Liz in Washington, but warns he'll show no mercy if he continues to interfere with his plans. During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack the Stark Cargo Plane transporting weaponry from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters. Although unsure if he can defeat Toomes without Stark's advanced tech, Parker realizes he cannot abandon his duties and leaves the dance, dons his homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair to confront him.</p>

He then confronts Toomes in the lair, who attempts to persuade him to his side. When Parker refuses, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves him to die under the rubble. Parker overcomes his self-doubt and escapes, before intercepting Toomes onboard the now-damaged plane and steering it towards the beach near Coney Island. The two engage in a confrontation that ends with Parker saving Toomes' life from his own unstable equipment and leaving him for the New York City Police Department.</p>

After receiving a call from Happy Hogan, Parker was asked to visit the Avengers' facility. Later, Stark offers Parker an even more advanced suit and an invitation to join the Avengers. Parker declines Stark's invitation in favor of remaining a 'friendly neighborhood' Spider-Man and inspires Stark to bring an engagement ring to a press conference where Pepper Potts is present. Upon returning home, Parker discovers that Stark has returned his upgraded suit and puts it on, and looks toward the window. Meanwhile, May is standing behind him the whole time and then cusses in astonishment.</p>
